# deCNN

This project is a hobby project of mine on how to create a computer vision model from scratch.
While building and training this model, I have been writing a Medium blog series describing my decisions. If you are interested in reading how I built this model and why I made certain decisions, be sure to check out my blog series <b>"Image Classification — Computer Vision From Scratch"</b>.
